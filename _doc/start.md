      Check out AppKit - an Angular admin theme I created with my developer friend [Tom Najdek](https://twitter.com/tnajdek)
      for developers. AppKit uses modern front-end technologies and is packed with useful components and widgets to speed up your app development.

      **[Tip for developers]:**{: .highlight}
      If your project is Open Source, you can use this area to promote your other projects or hold third party adverts like Bootstrap and FontAwesome do!
